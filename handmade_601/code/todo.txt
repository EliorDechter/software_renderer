  - Graphics upgrade
    - Fix unproject, GetCameraRectangleAtTarget
      - Handle divide-by-z in Unproject
      - Fix clip rectangles for debug UI
      - Fix Z settings for debug UI
    - Fix Z buffer to be better resolution - what's the best plan here?
    - Re-enable alpha fading
    - Re-enable fog
    - Particle systems
      - Bug with sliding relative to the grid during camera offset?
    - Transition to Real Artwork
      - Clean up our notion of multi-part entities and how they are animated
    - Lighting

  - Implement multiple sim regions per frame
    - Fix hash table routines in sim_region to not have to do clears on returns
      (just have them return a bool as to whether they found the entry or not)         
    - Eliminate world mode from sim step entirely
    - Per-entity clocking
    - Sim region merging?  For multiple players?
  
  - Collision detection?
    - Clean up predicate proliferation!  Can we make a nice clean
      set of flags/rules so that it's easy to understand how
      things work in terms of special handling?  This may involve
      making the iteration handle everything instead of handling
      overlap outside and so on.
    - Transient collision rules!  Clear based on flag.
      - Allow non-transient rules to override transient ones.
      - Entry/exit?
    - What's the plan for robustness / shape definition?
    - (Implement reprojection to handle interpenetration)
    - "Things pushing other things"

  PRODUCTION
  -> GAME
    - Rudimentary world gen (no quality, just "what sorts of things" we do)
      - Placement of background things
      - Connectivity?
        - Large-scale AI Pathfinding?
      - Non-overlapping?
      - Map display
        - Magnets - how they work???
    - Rigorous definition of how things move, when things trigger, etc.
  - Metagame / save game?
    - How do you enter "save slot"?
    - Persistent unlocks/etc.
    - Do we allow saved games?  Probably yes, just only for "pausing",
    * Continuous save for crash recovery?

  CLEAN UP
  - Debug code
    - Diagramming
    - Draw tile chunks so we can verify that things are aligned / in the chunks we want them to be in / etc.
    - Frame view not showing bad frames?
  - Hardware Rendering
    - Shaders?
  - Pixel Buffer Objects for texture downloads?
    
  - Audio
    - FIX CLICKING BUG AT END OF SAMPLES!!!

  EXTRA CREDIT :)
  - Serious optimization of the software renderer
